        <description>Heard a loud bang then another. Thought it might be my neighbor downstairs or a Semi-truck crash or rail accident. (Perhaps even max?) Even heard sirens which i figured were responding but i guess it was unrelated. Shook the house a bit but not bad. Seemed to be coming from the west more or less.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[From inside my house, I thought the sound came from the south (of 9th & Lambert). Interesting that others in the area, who were outside at the time, reported the sound more from the west.  <br><br>To me, it sounded like a large firework (M80...or higher) going off on the next street over.   I don't think it was an aircraft (F-15, etc...), as there was no other sound accompanying the boom.  Dynamite / Pipe Bomb seems like the most likely explanation, except for all of the reports farther afield...very strange.]]></description>

        <name>Big explosive sound</name>
        <description>Big boom, no shaking windows that I am aware of. I was outside my house. I thought it was an explosion of some kind. Reminded me of some bad thunder at the coast a couple years back.</description>

        <description>Loud boom, sounded south of us, but the window itself is south-facing. Definitely did not sound like fireworks, more like an explosion.</description>

        <description>caught a glimpse of a white flash before hearing the huge boom. Saw the white mushroom smoke cloud. It was in the exact same location as the one last week(10 days ago or so) but was bigger. Did not see anybody leave the scene. Definitely felt the explosion. It happened at 8:05 PM.</description>

        <description>Caught a glimpse of white light before hearing and fealing a huge boom. ran to the window and saw the white mushroom cloud rising from the same identical spot at Powers marine park, where it happened the first time, 10 or so days ago. Did not see anyone leaving the area. This explosion was at least twice as big as the last one. This one was huge. Researching the river side of the park where the sandy bank rises into the park should turn up something. Search directly across from the house boats.</description>

Woman in waterfront condo saw white flash across river at first boom. For the second boom same person said they were not looking during boom, but after looked over and saw a plum of smoke. The location boom came from seems about the same both times, approx 1/2 mile south of Sellwood Bridge. Both times we saw fireman and police respond to that location, both times they found nothing....]]></description>

        <description>Loud and clear, much bigger boom than the first a few weeks ago.  Shook house, rattled windows.  Neighbors all heard it and were calling each other for news.  No news, which is incredible, it came from somewhere!  Like an explosion, no way it was a transformer or sonic boom.  Could hardly believe the Sellwood Bridge was still standing, thought maybe it was a boom from it finally falling into the abyss.</description>

        <description>I heard a loud boom and just chalked it up to thunder as it was slightly sprinkling.  Although, I did think it was odd as there was no lightning.  It was a very defuse sound, that sounded like it was coming from the southwest.</description>

        <description>Boom was very loud and sharp, like it was very near. Sounded as if it were near Tacoma and the Sellwood bridge. Sharper than a sonic boom and bigger/deeper than any gun. Similar to a cannon or a dynamite explosion.</description>

        <description>Was outside when happened.  Loud enough to make me shudder but no shaking.  Thought it was close thunderclap but that made no sense. Was facing west when it hit and it was coming from that direction.  Sellwood or Oaks Bottom area makes most sense.</description>

        <name>Very loud and felt the whole house shake.</name>
        <description>My daughters had a loud movie playing downstairs, and still I felt the entire house shake and the noise was very loud.  I know other  people heard it because neighbors stuck out there heads and looked around like myself.  I would find it hard to believe it was just a pipe bomb, I grew up with my family working with dynamite on our family farm, and even a  stick would be loud, and create a huge hole. but I never felt the house shake like that, and that was very close to our house not miles away.</description>
